        <h2 class="ex2">Assignment 1 - Video Edit</h2>
        <center><iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AaH5KpN1AY4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
      
<br>
<p class="ex2">Assignment 1 was a video editing project done via Adobe Premiere Pro. The task was to edit a video with chocie of reference videos and copyright free audio. <br><br>

    I made sure that there was a smooth transition between the visuals in the scenes. This to allow the audience to know the character's position at any given scene. For example, after the enemy spy (man) runs away, it cuts to the spy kid opening the curtains to check if he is really gone. It ends with the man walking further away as the spy kid stares out to make sure that he has left.
    
<br><br>
    
    Unfortunately, I was unsuccessful in syncing my choice of audio with my footage. What was being heard was not compatible with what was shown. For example, the audio is of running footsteps but the video depicts a man walking.
    
<br><br>
    
    I had to carefully choose which footage could be interpreted in the way I wanted my storyline to go. Cliche scenes from a spy movie typically include damaged property, hence the inclusion of the broken window as part of my edited video. Self-destructed phones after a brief call is also common. Therefore, I had a scene of the spy kid talking over the phone.
    
<br><br>
    
    I learnt that sound plays a huge role in evoke emotions in a film. It is easy to get caught up in the idea that visuals play the most important role in making or breaking a good film. I utilised the appropriate sounds as accompaniment to movement in my film. A big factor which had my audience understand that I was trying to make a spy film was the insertion of stereotypical spy background music. To make things more dramatic, I dragged out certain sounds, such as the explosion at the end of the film. I made it much louder in contrast to the silence right before the explosion. With only the background music being continually played till the very end.
    
    <br><br>
    
     Some of my favourite films from my childhood were action-comedy films. I had a fascination with spy movies which included Johnny English or Men in Black. An action-comedy film that I particularly remembered enjoying and watching a few times was Rush Hour. There was this adrenaline rush I would get as a child, while watching these movies. It felt almost as if I was part of the team and in on the action as well. Laughter also brought people together and that was why I was so fond of the comedy genre. 
    
<br>
    
    Therefore, considering my soft spot for action-comedy film, the theme that I chose for this video editing assignment was action-comedy. The video reference that I used involved many scenes with children. Hence, I decided to make my main character to be a spy kid from a family of spies. The mild comedy that is witnessed is mostly from the arrogant yet cowardly enemy spy who tried to ambush the main character at the start of the film.
    
<br><br>
     I mainly included scenes that can be found in most spy films to guide my audience to understand that I am trying to go into the direction of a spy film. This includes scenes such as shooting resulting in damaged property, meeting briefings at the the table, a lot of suspicious glances, etc.</p>

      <h2 class="ex3">Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons</h2>
      <iframe src="https://s3940113.github.io/s3940113/" height="450" width="1500" title="Icon Website"></iframe>

      <p class="ex3">Assignment 2 was a graphic icons project done via Adobe Illustrator. The task was to create a suite of nine icons that showcased unity and followed the choice of prompt. <br><br>

The idea behind my suite of icons stems from my personal interest in fashion and my extreme fondness for Japanese culture. It was a way for me to express my love for clothes, in this case the Kimono, for an assignment. The reasons for choosing the different themes for my kimonos vary from wanting to include some of my mother's heritage, styles that I am interested in and characters I have affection towards.
        
    <br><br>
        
        I did not really iterate through that many sketches before settling on single design. I had a clear idea in my head on how I would like certain things to appear. These iterated sketches was mostly so that I could test out my colour palette to pair up the most complementary colours together. That, or to find the most suitable colour. that best represented the characters or costumes I chose.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Not much was lost when transferring my thumbnail sketches onto my final flat designs. I am much more proficient in drawing with traditional mediums such as pencil and paper. Therefore, the model for my thumbnail sketches would definitely. have been much neater than what I could sketch out on Illustrator.
        
        <br>
        
        It did work out for the better in the end. I was able to think of much more unique kimono designs in order to accommodate my inexperience in Illustrator. I had to think out of the box and constantly tweak my designs to make it fit my template without looking too ordinary. An example would be my Sunflower Kimono. I had originally wanted to make numerous small sunflowers in the same shape and size all over the kimono. It was however, a tad challenging to fit them all without looking too uniform yet disorganised. That was when I came up with the idea that maybe flowers could grow out of of her, thus making the design a bit more ethereal. My design ended appearing much better than I thought, therefore I chose it as my final flat design.
        
        <br><br>
        
        I did not use colour to create a sense of unity for these icons. Instead, I went with another approach of having the same model kimono template used throughout my nine designs. My colour palette choices varied from the different themes that I chose for each kimono. They were meant to emulate the animal, costume, item or character in which their design took inspiration from. 
        
        <br><br>
         The sound choices I used ranged from my ambiguous impression of characters to imitating the environment in which the object or animal can be found in. This allows the sound to pair well with the overall visual of the individual kimono designs.
        
         <br><br>
        
        It took me quite some time to figure out how I wanted to approach this task based off my prompt being 'Community'. I was contemplating choosing between a community's culture that I am in interested in (Japan) vs a community's culture that might be more relevant to me (Chinese, natives from Sarawak). I decided to incorporate both after asking for valued feedback and opinions from family, friends and my lecturer.</p>

        <h2 class="ex4">Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment</h2>
        <center><iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GnlicExBbpo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
      
        <p class="ex4"> Assignment 3 was virtual environment created on Unity. The task was to build an environment that was personable to you. It involves something that has changed you as a person or made a lasting impression. <br><br>
            To me, a working prototype was not too important at the beginning stages of my design process. My priority was planning out the layout on how I wanted to place objects and what can I scour free of charge from the Unity Assets store. 
            
            <br><br>
            
            I was never inclined in anything 3D related. This made creating a virtual environment much more challenge than producing 2D media. It took a lot of trial and error to figure out my way around the software in order to make my environment. 
            
            <br>
            
            The experience was different because all of my objects had already been created for me and what I needed to do was strategically place them to build my world. On the other hand, my previous icon project was heavily dependent on my ability to draw using Illustrator's tools and to create my own colours to suit my designs.
            
            <br><br>
            
            The POV that is being seen in my project was my memory of how it was like being a tourist on a cruise ship when I was young. It is now seen from an older perspective. Hence, the inclusion of activities in which adults would partake in. Such as lounging peacefully by the pool or partying at the front of the ship.
            
            <br>
            
            The POV in Assignment 3 is very different from Assignment 1 because it is from a first person's perspective. In Assignment 1, the main character is the spy kid, thus the audience is viewing everything as a third party. 
            
            <br><br>
            
           The purpose of the sound that was used for this virtual environment is give a sense of realism to the environment. What could be heard on a ship or at party is included. Hence the insertion of lulling waves in the background, creaking floorboards and music for the dance party. This is similar to what I did for my video editing assignment by making the audio match up with what can be visually seen.
            
           <br><br>
            
            The different elements included in my virtual environment is unified by the fact that all these areas can commonly be found aboard a cruise ship. These is a pool area, dining area and party entertainment area.
            
            <br><br>
            
            Had I not test my build multiple times throughout my design process, I would not have known that I lacked a Rigidbody in most of my objects to prevent it from floating away or sinking. 
            
            <br>
            
            The play testing also allows me to get an overview of the layout from the first person's perspective. I can determine if anything is lacking to make up for the relaxed cruise vibe I was trying to imitate or if I was including too many things, thus making the space overcrowded.</p>
